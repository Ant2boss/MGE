# MGEngine
A console "addon"

I call it an addon because it doesn't do anything that the current console can't do. But finding these features can be fairly annoying, so I just grouped a bunch of these features in a relativley small package that makes these features easy to use.
Also it's a small "8-bit" graphics engine, which is also pretty cool.

MGEngine / V 1.0.2 / 12.07.2020. / C++ / Windows only

[1.0.1] Fixed shape sizes, so that they are actually correct

[1.0.2] Removed FONT keyword from method names, made it so clicking with the mouse stops the >> operator from canvas, made it so you can change specific buttons in GUI_ButtonList

*Note: The Code you are provided with is very simple to look at, that means that there are probably alot of oversights*

*Documentation coming soon!!!*
